I'm Sophus, a second-year undergraduate student at Peking University's School of Physics.

I'm currently interested in condensed matter physics theory, specifically in topological and strong-correlation phenomena in real crystal materials. Some topics of interest include:
- The interaction of electrons in topological flat-band systems. Flat-bands enhance interactions by suppressing kinetic energy, and when these bands are topological, they can give rise to novel phenomena, such as those observed in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) and the Lieb/Kagome lattices.
- Emergent phenomena in condensed matter systems (still exploring).

I'm doing undergraduate research in [Prof. Zhida Song](https://icqm.pku.edu.cn/yw/directory/faculty/932182.htm)'s group now.
