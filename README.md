README forked from <https://academicpages.github.io>, but I selected the important ones.

1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the `files/` directory. They will appear at <https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf>.
2. (Optional) Use the Jupyter notebooks or python scripts in the `markdown_generator` folder to generate markdown files for publications and talks from a TSV file.
